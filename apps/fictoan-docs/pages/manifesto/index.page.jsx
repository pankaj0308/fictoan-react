                            Fictoan stems from the idea that true hand-off between the designer and developer must be in
                            code, rather than a set of static images or artboards. The designer should be in complete
                            control of the interface and the experience, rather than the developer trying to interpret
                            the designer’s intentions via a document.

                            This framework basically aims to blur the lines between the designer and a developer. Why
                            must there be a rift, this gaping chasm between the two roles? The goal must be to build and
                            ship, and not bicker about the pixel-perfectness of a particular component or the hover
                            colour of a element. These things are best left to the designer, so that the developer can
                            spend their time on things like performance and deployments.

                            While design tools are getting better and powerful by the day, there’s nothing really quite
                            the same as passing off working code. We think this will remain true for quite some time,
                            and in the meanwhile, see how we can make the lives of a designer and a developer easier.

                            The other principle Fictoan is built around is simplicity and obviousness. This is best
                            reflected in the naming conventions and the prop nomenclature.

                            The idea is to remove the entry barriers for people dipping their toes into code for the
                            first time, especially for those from a design background. The easiest way to do this is to
                            simply keep everything in plain English, and not introduce complexities and conditional
                            hierarchies, that is most often the case with most other frameworks.
